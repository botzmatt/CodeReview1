            <p><h4>About Me</h4>
             I was born in Flint, Michigan. I am the youngest of three boys. I moved out to Portland because the declining economy in Michigan did not show itself as revitalizing after 2008. I used to come out to Portland almost every summer to visit family, and I grew to love the area pretty quickly. I work as an external vendor for Microsoft as a Quality Engineer, testing video games. I have a team of 9 testers that I manage and direct in their everyday testing. We work on the game Killer Instinct; a remake of a 1990's classic fighting game.<br>

             <br> I also met the love of my life out here in Portland. I am married to Lindsay Botz and have three wonderful kids. I would not trade them for anything in the world. They make me feel truly complete.<br>
